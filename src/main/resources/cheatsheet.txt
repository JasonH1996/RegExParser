Query results appear here!!

Buttons are used to simplify search functions.
If some of them are used while the composer is empty, then it will be applied to the full query instead.

NOTE: MODIFY FILE SEARCH TO REPLACE \ WITH \\ IN THE QUERY BEFORE SEARCHING. 

INSTRUCTIONS

EXACT: This means "Exactly this series of characters". It establishes a literal sequence with /Q and /E. This means that everything after /Q and before /E is used exactly as typed for the search. Functions *cannot* be used in a literal sequence.

NOT: This means "Not this sequence of characters". This starts a "not" operation using ^; the ^ character MUST be at the start of a sequence wrapped in parentheses.

TO: This means, for example, any letter between and including a to e, or 0 to 325. It takes either your caret position or a selected text, and gets either the first letter, or the entire most recent number.

OR: This means "This OR this." It takes either your caret position, or selected text. If there is no selected text, then it will insert (|) and place the caret after the first parentheses. If text is selected, it will put the first parentheses behind it, put |) after, then move the caret between the | and ) characters. If caret/selection is already within parentheses, it will just insert a | character.

ANY: This represents single instance character except a newline. Places a period.

*0/1 of: This means "This sequence/character once or not at all". Places a question mark.

*0+ of: This means "This sequence/character 0 or more times". Places an asterisk.

*1+ of: This means "This sequence/character 1 or more times". Places a plus sign. 

*n+ of: This means "This sequence/character exactly n times", where n is a number you enter, in between {} characters. You can also use {n,} for "n or more times" or {n,m} for "n to m times".

CASE SENSITIVE: This means "The following sequence is case sensitive". Activates case sensitivity mode by inputting (?i:), which is on by default.

CASE INSENSITIVE: This means "The following sequence is case insensitive". Activates case sensitivity mode by inputting (?-i:), which is off by default.

LINE STARTS WITH: This means "Line starts at this point." This is done by inputting a ^ character, which cannot be done as the first character within parentheses; in those cases, the button will insert the ^ outside the parentheses.

LINE ENDS WITH: This means "Line ends at this point." This is done by inputting a $ character; this should be done at the end of a search in most cases, unless followed by a newline character, "(\r\n|\r|\n)"

IF, THEN: 

ELSE: 

* If used after a parentheses, applies for that entire sequence. If placed after another character, applies for that single character. 



CHEAT SHEET EXAMPLES

(?i) = case sensitivity active

(abc) = abc
(a|b|c) = a OR b OR c
[abc] = a OR b OR c

(?!a|b|c) = NOT a OR b OR c  <--- this is what is used by the program
[^abc] = NOT a OR b OR c
(?!abc) = NOT abc

\d = any single number
\D = any single NON-number

y{x} = y occurs x number of times

\ = allows a special character
\. = returns "."
\* = returns "*"

^abc = line starts with abc
abc$ = line ends with abc

b(?=a)  = find where b is followed by a
(?<=a)b = find where b is preceded by a
b(?!a)  = find where b is not followed by a
(?<!a)b = find where b is not preceded by a

Example Search returns lines that a word that starts with a capital B or 
an H/h(case insensitive), has any three characters following, then ends with y.
